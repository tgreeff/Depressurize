Depressurize

What are you waiting for? Nobody’s gonna save you from them.

Overview
After waking up, you are forced to take survival into your own hands on a destroyed
and infested ship. You will have to repel an alien life form or lay low on a space 
cruiser or explore an array of ships, stations, asteroids, planets, or moons, where 
you can collect materials to contribute to your survival, destroy the infestation, 
or save others from certain doom. See how long you last. Construct a base to keep 
you safe and store any item you can’t carry in your cross-dimensional relay storage. 
Be careful though, whatever you store needs to be printed back out, so make sure you 
hold on to what you can in your backpack.
