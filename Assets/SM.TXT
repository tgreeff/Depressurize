 :: SPECIFIC INFO FOR THIS FONT ::
 
 I guess this is the first ever font I have sketched on paper before going into
 the editor and making it. And IMO the planning has paid off - this has quickly
 become one of my favorite fonts, beating JH_TITLES and New Horizons, which are
 now 2nd and 3rd respectively. I hope you'll also enjoy it.

 This font was made for making titles for my website and my pictures, so it has
 certain specific optimizations. When used on-screen it will look the best with
 font sizes starting with 12 and then any next 12. That is 12, 24, 36, 48, etc.

 And as an added bonus this one is actually pretty darn readable and looks cool
 at size 6! Well, to me on my PC anyway. :)

 Enjoy, and don't forget to send feedback and tell me what characters you would
 like to see added.
